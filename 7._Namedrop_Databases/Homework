1: List 6 relational databases.
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL
    - Oracle Database
    - SQL Server
    - PostgreSQL
    - Firebird

2: List at least 1 of each of the NoSQL categories.
    - Document Databases
    - Key-value Stores
    - Column-oriented Databases
    - Graph Databases


3: List 2 in-memory databases.
    - H2 Database
    - HyperSQL Database


Notes:
    - NoSQL is an umbrella term to describe any alternative system to traditional SQL databases
    - Use a data model that has a different structure than the row and column table model with relational databases.
    - Document Database
        . Stores database in JSON,BSOn, or CML documents. Documents can be nested. Elements can be indexed for faster
          querying.
    - Key-Value Stores
        . Simplest. Every data element is stored as key value pair consisting of an attribute name or key
    - Column-Oriented
        . Store is organized as a set of columns compared to a relational where data is stored in rows and reads the
          data row by row.
    - Graph
        . Focused on relationship between data elements. Elements are stored as a node. Connection between elements are
          called links or relationships.


    - In-Memory Database relies on system memory as opposed to disk space for storage of data. Memory access is faster
      than disk access. They are naturally faster
    - H2
        . Open source database written in Java that supports standard AQL for both embedded and standalone databases.
          Very fast and contained within a JAR of only approximately 1.5MB.
        . To use H2 Maven dependency must be added. Maven is chiefly used for java-based projects, helping to download
          dependencies which refers to the libraries or JAR files. Helps get the right JAR files for each project as
          there may be different versions of separate packages.
        . Connection string could be used with the protocol mem to connect to a H2 in-memory database followed by the
          database name. driverClassName, URL, username, and password properties can be placed in a .properties file to
          be read by an application.
    - HSQLDB (HyperSQL Database)
        . Open source project also written in Java which represents a relational database. Follows the SQL and JDBC
          and supports SQL features such as stored procedures and triggers
        . Uses Maven Dependency
        . Configuration
            . driverClassName=org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver
              url=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:myDb
              username=sa
              password=sa

    - Persistent Databases or Traditional databases is an "on-disk" cache frequently requested data in memory for faster
      access but write database updates, insertions and deletes through the cache to be stored to a disk.
    - In-Memory databases stores data entirely in main memory. Working with data in memory is significantly faster than
      writing to and reading from a file system.
